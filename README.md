# Blockchain & DAG Networks Latency Comparison

An interactive visualization tool comparing latency and performance between different blockchain and DAG networks in real-time.

Simulation link: https://macmachi.github.io/NetworksLatencyComparison/

## üéØ Features

- Real-time network latency simulation
- Visual comparison between BlockDAG, Blockchain and DAG
- Blockchain trilemma metrics display (Scalability, Security, Decentralization)
- Simulation controls (speed, pause, reset)
- Responsive and intuitive interface

## üîç Analyzed Networks

- Kaspa Testnet (BlockDAG - PoW)
- Solana (Blockchain - PoS)
- Kaspa Mainnet (BlockDAG - PoW)  
- Avalanche (DAG - PoS)
- Ethereum (Blockchain - PoS)
- Bitcoin (Blockchain - PoW)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rymentz/Protocol-Benchmark.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## üìä Evaluated Metrics

- Network latency
- Block/transaction count
- 24h relative performance
- Blockchain trilemma rating (‚≠ê system)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This simulation provides a simplified representation for educational purposes. Real-world performance depends on many additional factors such as:
- Transaction throughput per block
- Network conditions and congestion
- Consensus mechanism specifics
- Validation requirements
- Technical architecture (Blockchain, DAG, BlockDAG)
